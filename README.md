- The 50 Days SQL Challenge is a structured learning journey designed to help me master SQL (Structured Query Language) concepts and practical applications step-by-step.
- Over the course of 50 days, I will work through hands-on exercises, real-world scenarios, and incremental challenges that will strengthen your database querying skills.


## This challenge provides a roadmap to:

- Understand SQL basics and syntax.
- Explore key database concepts like tables, joins, and normalization.
- Perform advanced data analysis with aggregate functions, subqueries, and window functions.
- Optimize and troubleshoot SQL queries.
- Work with real datasets to gain practical experience..
