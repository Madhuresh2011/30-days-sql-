# 50-days-sql-Challenge



-- The 50 Days SQL Challenge is a structured learning journey designed to help me master SQL (Structured Query Language) concepts and practical applications step-by-step. 
-- Over the course of 50 days, I will work through hands-on exercises, real-world scenarios, and incremental challenges that will strengthen your database querying skills.


## This challenge provides a roadmap to:

-- Understand SQL basics and syntax.
-- Explore key database concepts like tables, joins, and normalization.
-- Perform advanced data analysis with aggregate functions, subqueries, and window functions.
-- Optimize and troubleshoot SQL queries.
-- Work with real datasets to gain practical experience.
